# To-Do List Web Application

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do list. It provides an intuitive interface for adding tasks, marking them as completed, and removing them from the list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can enter their tasks in the input field and click the "Add" button to add them to the to-do list.
- **Task list**: The added tasks are displayed as a list on the web page.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: By clicking on a task, users can mark it as completed, and it will be visually indicated by a strike-through effect.
- **Remove tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "x" button next to each task.
- **Data persistence**: The application uses the browser's local storage to store the to-do list, ensuring that the tasks are saved even if the user closes the browser.
